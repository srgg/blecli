Please localize the requested scope and conduct a comprehensive code quality assessment for it, to analyze the areas listed below.

The scope must be deducted from arguments if provided as folows: if #$ARGUMENTS is not empty figure out what is provided: file or ;anguge construct and set it as a scope.
If #$ARGUMENTS are not provided and IDE integration setedup, check selection in ide integration if somethign selected treat it as a scope.
If #$ARGUMENTS are not provided and no IDE integration setedup or nothign selected in IDE, use current File opened in IDE as a scope.

If scope is ot determined ask to clarify teh scope and rerun the command.

As oosn as =scope is determined pritn user friendly promt sharing teh loclized scope and ask confirmation to proceed: Yes, NO.

If it is confiemre than conduct a comprehensive code quality assessment for it, to analyze the areas listed below:

## **Code Quality & Standards**
- Go idioms and best practices adherence
- Code clarity, readability, and maintainability
- Naming conventions (types, functions, variables, packages)
- Error handling patterns and robustness
- Documentation quality (comments, godoc)
- Test coverage and testing patterns

## **Architecture & Design**
- Overall architecture patterns and design principles
- Separation of concerns and modularity
- Interface design and abstractions
- Dependency management and coupling
- Package structure and organization
- Design patterns usage (appropriate/inappropriate)

## **Production Readiness**
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Logging and observability considerations
- Configuration management
- Resource management (goroutines, channels, memory)
- Concurrency safety and race condition risks
- Performance considerations and bottlenecks

## **Go-Specific Analysis**
- Effective use of Go's concurrency primitives
- Channel usage patterns and best practices
- Interface usage and composition
- Memory allocation patterns
- Garbage collection considerations
- Standard library usage vs external dependencies

## **Security & Reliability**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Resource leaks (goroutines, file handles, connections)
- Panic prevention and recovery
- Data race detection needs

## **Framework & Utilities Assessment**
- Third-party dependencies evaluation
- Framework choices appropriateness
- Custom utilities vs standard library
- Testing frameworks and tools usage

## **Recommendations**
Provide specific, actionable recommendations for:
- **Immediate improvements** needed
- **Long-term architectural** enhancements
- **Performance optimizations**
- **Production deployment** considerations
- **Code organization** improvements

**Please be specific with examples and suggest concrete improvements where applicable.**
